# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Wave implemeation

Yes, you can display the waveform of an audio file using various libraries that analyze and visualize audio data. One of the most popular libraries for this purpose is **WaveSurfer.js**, which is specifically designed to visualize audio waveforms. You can also use the **Web Audio API** directly to analyze audio data and create a custom visualization using tools like **Canvas**.

Here, I'll show you two methods to display the waveform of an audio file:

### Option 1: Using **WaveSurfer.js**

WaveSurfer.js is a library that simplifies audio waveform visualization and provides controls for audio playback.

#### Steps to Integrate WaveSurfer.js:

1. **Install WaveSurfer.js**:

   You can install WaveSurfer.js using npm or yarn:

   ```bash
   npm install wavesurfer.js
   ```

   Or

   ```bash
   yarn add wavesurfer.js
   ```

2. **Create a Waveform Component**:

   You can create a `Waveform` component to load and display the waveform of an audio file.

#### `Waveform.js`:
```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';
import WaveSurfer from 'wavesurfer.js';

const Waveform = ({ audioFile }) => {
  const waveformRef = useRef(null);
  const waveSurfer = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!waveformRef.current) return;

    // Initialize WaveSurfer
    waveSurfer.current = WaveSurfer.create({
      container: waveformRef.current,
      waveColor: '#ddd',
      progressColor: '#f00',
      cursorColor: '#333',
      height: 80,
      barWidth: 2,
      responsive: true,
    });

    // Load the audio file into WaveSurfer
    waveSurfer.current.load(audioFile);

    // Cleanup on unmount
    return () => waveSurfer.current.destroy();
  }, [audioFile]);

  return <div ref={waveformRef} />;
};

export default Waveform;
```

3. **Use the `Waveform` Component in Your App**:

   You can now use the `Waveform` component to display the waveform of an audio file.

#### Example in `App.js`:
```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import Waveform from './Waveform';
import './style/App.css';

const App = () => {
  const [audioFile, setAudioFile] = useState('path/to/audiofile.mp3');

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Audio Waveform Visualizer</h1>
      <Waveform audioFile={audioFile} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

### Key Points:
- **WaveSurfer.js** handles both the audio playback and waveform visualization.
- You can easily pass the `audioFile` as a prop to the `Waveform` component to visualize the audio file.
- It supports many customization options, such as changing the colors, height, and more.

### Option 2: Using **Web Audio API** and **Canvas**

If you prefer more control over how the waveform is displayed, you can use the **Web Audio API** along with **Canvas** to create your own waveform visualizer.

#### Steps to Create Custom Visualization:

1. **Analyze Audio Data Using Web Audio API**:

   You can use the `AnalyserNode` from the Web Audio API to extract frequency data and plot it on a `canvas` element.

#### Example Code for Custom Visualization:

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useRef } from 'react';

const AudioVisualizer = ({ audioBuffer }) => {
  const canvasRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!audioBuffer) return;

    const canvas = canvasRef.current;
    const canvasCtx = canvas.getContext('2d');

    const audioContext = new (window.AudioContext || window.webkitAudioContext)();
    const analyser = audioContext.createAnalyser();
    analyser.fftSize = 2048;

    const source = audioContext.createBufferSource();
    source.buffer = audioBuffer;
    source.connect(analyser);
    analyser.connect(audioContext.destination);

    source.start();

    const bufferLength = analyser.frequencyBinCount;
    const dataArray = new Uint8Array(bufferLength);

    const drawWaveform = () => {
      requestAnimationFrame(drawWaveform);

      analyser.getByteTimeDomainData(dataArray);

      canvasCtx.fillStyle = 'rgb(200, 200, 200)';
      canvasCtx.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

      canvasCtx.lineWidth = 2;
      canvasCtx.strokeStyle = 'rgb(0, 0, 0)';

      canvasCtx.beginPath();

      const sliceWidth = (canvas.width * 1.0) / bufferLength;
      let x = 0;

      for (let i = 0; i < bufferLength; i++) {
        const v = dataArray[i] / 128.0;
        const y = (v * canvas.height) / 2;

        if (i === 0) {
          canvasCtx.moveTo(x, y);
        } else {
          canvasCtx.lineTo(x, y);
        }

        x += sliceWidth;
      }

      canvasCtx.lineTo(canvas.width, canvas.height / 2);
      canvasCtx.stroke();
    };

    drawWaveform();

    // Clean up on unmount
    return () => {
      audioContext.close();
    };
  }, [audioBuffer]);

  return <canvas ref={canvasRef} width={600} height={200} />;
};

export default AudioVisualizer;
```

2. **Use the `AudioVisualizer` Component**:

   You can use this component to display the waveform for an `audioBuffer` loaded using your `loadAudio` function from the previous example.

#### Example in `SampleButton.js`:
```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { loadAudio } from './audioManager';
import AudioVisualizer from './AudioVisualizer';

const SampleButton = ({ sample }) => {
  const [audioBuffer, setAudioBuffer] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchAudio = async () => {
      const buffer = await loadAudio(`./samples/${sample.path}`);
      setAudioBuffer(buffer);
    };
    fetchAudio();
  }, [sample]);

  return (
    <div>
      <button>{sample.filename}</button>
      {audioBuffer && <AudioVisualizer audioBuffer={audioBuffer} />}
    </div>
  );
};

export default SampleButton;
```

### Key Points:
- **Web Audio API**: You use the `AnalyserNode` to get time-domain data of the audio and plot it on a canvas.
- **Canvas**: You can customize the visualizer by adjusting colors, line width, and the type of visualization you want.

### Which Option to Choose:
- **WaveSurfer.js** is easier to implement and provides a lot of functionality out of the box (including controls for playback).
- **Custom Web Audio API + Canvas** gives you full control and flexibility over the visualization, but it requires more manual work.
